pgl is an open-source project. We like many authors contributing their work to
this project. This is an attempt to list all authors and contributors.

Authors:
    jre <jre-phoenix@users.sourceforge.net>, created pglcmd, based on his
        previous blockcontrol, previously moblock-control. Based on init &
        update script for peerguardnf from the forum at methlabs.org
        (predecessor of phoenixlabs.org). Debian packager. Project coordinator.
    Morpheus <ebutera@users.berlios.de>, created the original MoBlock.
    Dimitris Palyvos-Giannas <jimaras@gmail.com>, created mobloquer.
        Reimplemented dbus in pgld.
    Jindrich Makovicka <makovick@gmail.com>, wrote original nfblockd, based on
        MoBlock.
    jpv, initially created dbus support for nfblock.
    Cader <cade.robinson@gmail.com>, heavily modified nfblockd, so that it
        became pgld. Also worked on pglcmd and previously much other stuff.
    freemind <fr33mind@users.sourceforge.net>, wrote pglgui, based on mobloquer.
    hasufell <julian.ospald@googlemail.com>, added autotools support.

Contributors:
    Pierre Buard (Gilrain): AUR maintainer, contributed systemd files.
    godmachine81: slackware packager.
    Santiago M. Mola: nfblock build fixes and cleanups.
    uljanow <uljanow@users.sourceforge.net>: author of iplist
        (iplist.sourceforge.net). Both moblock (especially the marking feature)
        and blockcontrol (a complete patch for "test") did profit from his
        knowledge and *active* help. Seeing the author of another program
        helping, shows that he got the spirit of opensource. Thank you and all
        the best wishes.
    sloter <laurent at sloter.org>: initial man page for moblock and
        moblock-control, initial moblock-control test function.
    David Walluck: contributor to MoBlock, porter of listtools (libp2p/
        mergep2p) from peerguardian.sourceforge.com (not yet integrated in
        pgl), worked on RPM packaging.
    lestlest <clessing@users.sourceforge.net>: original Debian packaging, some
        parts of the scripts, moblock logfile rotation patches, moblock pid
        file creation.
    JFM, /meth/usr and probably others from the forum at methlabs.org: made the
        first steps for the init & update script.

    ... and many more. To be continued ...
