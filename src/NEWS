pgl 2.3.2 (unreleased)

  This is still work in progress, not everything works, don't use blindly!

  * pgl supports multiple allowlists now. All files in the directories
    LOCAL_ALLOWLISTS_IN_DIR, LOCAL_ALLOWLISTS_OUT_DIR and
    LOCAL_ALLOWLISTS_FWD_DIR are used as allowlists for their respective
    connection direction.
  * The IP whitelisting variables WHITE_IP_IN, WHITE_IP_OUT and WHITE_IP_FWD
    aren't used anymore. Their settings are moved automatically to the
    allowlists pgl.p2p in their respective directories.
  * New pglcmd option configure. ... wip

pgl 2.3.0 New default blocklists and MARKing for everyone

  [jre]
  * The default blocklist setup changed to a lighter one with Bluetack lists:
    TBG has been dropped because it isn't updated on iblocklist anymore. Search
    the web to learn how to continue to get them.
    Instead we are back to some Bluetack lists, although probably with a less
    paranoid selection.
    Everybody is strongly encouraged to do his own research on the quality of
    the several blocklist providers. Then you can select the correct blocklists
    based on your own personal needs.
    Comments welcome!
  * removed the (non-default) feature to directly DROP and ACCEPT packets
    (as in MoBlock 0.8), instead of using the (default) MARKing feature.
    Reason:
    ACCEPTing/DROPing packets directly was only needed for kernel/netfilter
    not supporting MARKing. Probably it was also a bit more efficient than
    MARKing.
    But ACCEPTing packets directly breaks other iptables setups - this has
    always been documented, but wasn't known to all users. So in order to
    avoid misconfigurations I decided to drop this feature.
    DROPing directly should not yield any drawbacks, but I decided to also
    remove it in order to make the code simpler.
