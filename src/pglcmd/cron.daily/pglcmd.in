# if-up is similar, but exits successfully if CONTROL_MAIN is not there, yet.
# This can happen in early boot stages before local file systems are mounted.

# CONTROL_MAIN has to be set correctly in all just mentioned files.
# Except for debian/pglcmd.postinst, this is done automatically on "make" based
# on the "configure" options.
